            Bookish is a site that all members of book clubs should know about. It helps you prep for your next meeting with
            discussion guides, book quizzes, and book games. There are even food and drink suggestions, as well as playlist
            recommendations.
            
            But the site is more than just book club meetings. It also offers lots of editorial content. That comes in the form of
            author interviews, opinion essays, book reviews and recommendations, reading challenges, and giveaways.
